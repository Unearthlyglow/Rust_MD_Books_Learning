# Section 1

Lauren, I AM TIRED! BUT encouraged that things are working over here. Hopefully the deployments today are going better than yesterday. If you are curious why I wanted to know about your goals, it's because I wanted to encourage you as much as you encourage me. 

Also....there's no spelling/grammar check on this thing so EAT IT!

This Rust MD Book is one of the coolr technologies I've found lately!
